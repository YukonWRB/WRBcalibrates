WRBcalibrates is a package to aid the Yukon Water Resources Branch in collecting and storing calibration data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of WRBcalibrates from GitHub using the code below. Note however that the repository is private; you'll need to be a member of YukonWRB or have a token issued for you by a member.

``` r
devtools::install.github("YukonWRB/WRBcalibrates")
```

Stable/production versions of the package are available on the G drive at: G:\water\Common\_GW_SW\R-packages\WRBcalibrates.

## Data storage back-end

The app is designed to work with either Google Sheets or with an SQL back-end. The package contains functions to create a local .SQLite database (db_create()), and the function calConnect() can be used to connect to the database. The logic behind creating a connection function instead of simply using DBI::dbConnect() is that, if the database type changes or if options need to be specified for the database connection, the default parameters of calConnect() can be changed and will automatically apply to every connection made via calConnect. Once connected, the database type does not matter as long as it accepts standard SQL language and is relational.
